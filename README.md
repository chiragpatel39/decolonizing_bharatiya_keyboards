## Why this Repo
Most people (more than 95%) type Bhartiya languages using transliteration. There are many disadvantages of typing using transliteration compared to direct typing using inscript keyboard.

### Flaws of Transliteration: 
1. We first convert a word from our native script to Roman equivalent and then transliterator converts it back it into Bhartiya Scripts.
2. Transliterators are not 100% accuracte. In fact, it becomes highly inacurate when we use uncommon words.
3. Some words just cannnot be written with transliteration. Try writing our national song : 'Vande Mataram' using it.
4. We also make mistakes in mental conversion of native script to roman script. 
5. We need to use more keystrokes to write same word. Ex. To write चिराग using Inscript Keyboard, I need 5 keystrokes (च,ि,र,ा,ग). Transliteration would require   6 keystrokes (c,h,i,r,a,g). 

### Advantages of Inscript
1. It requires less key strokes compared to transliteration.
2. Inscript is designed specifically for Bharatiya languages. Indian Languages follow consonent-vowel sequence. Left side of keyboard has Swaras and right side has Vyanjanas. Therefore, we can type faster with alternate hand action.
3. The position of alphabets is same across all the Indian Languages. So If one learns to type in Telugu, he can type in Marathi also.
4. It is very easy to learn as it uses inherent logic of Bharatiya alphabets.
5. No mental stress as it is no longer require to convert every word to roman script in mind.
6. Accurate: It is direct typing method. It will type what you want. It can type "Vande Mataram" easily.

### Results:
In my testing with Gujarati, transliteration required 23% more keystrokes.

### Question : 
Why we don't have Bharatiya alphabets on keyboards. Rest of the world have it. The image shown above is Thai Magic Keyboard from Apple.
